# EDA216_projekt
Project in EDA216



We have created three different executables according to the short summary in the project descrition.
- One view for the production of pallets.
- One view for blocking pallets. 
- One view to search for pallets using product name, pallets created within a given time span, blocked pallets, pallets delivered to certain
customer and the unique pallet ID number. 

The three executables are called Production, Blocked, Search.

Run a program by being in the directory "executables" and run the different programs by typing:
"java -jar filename".
